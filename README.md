# Add-1-
Sinmple game "Add 1" in ios that works with a timer. 

One of the first Swift tutorials I started, this tutorial was originally written by Ray Wenderlich for Swift 5. After a devastating realization that I could not follow the tutorial on a computer that could only run Swift 1.2, and unwilling to spend on new hardware at the beginning of my journey, I instead took it on as a challenge to adapt the game for Swift 1.2 based of Ray Wenderlich's tutorial.
